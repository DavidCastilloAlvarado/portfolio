Making robots and data science are my passions. My name is David Castillo and I have a bachelor degree in Mechatronic Engineering since 2018, I have held trainee positions in large and medium companies, developing data exploratory and data analysis for business intelligence, my background like a Mechatronic allow me transitioned into data science from a hardware IoT developer. Since 2017 I have decided to start making YouTube videos to share my experiences and to hopefully help others get break into the robotics, machine learning and business intelligence field.
